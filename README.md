# SmileOrNot
This is my project playing around with OpenCV. It detects whether you are smiling or not and displays a respective emoji for your emotion.
This is my "great value" animoji. With two emojis, "smiling" and "sad". This could be expanded to capture more emotions and overlay the emoji over your face instead.
